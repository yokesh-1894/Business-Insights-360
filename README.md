## Importing data into PowerBi

In this project, since we are using MySQL as the database, we will have to transfer the datasets from the MySQL database to PowerBI by entering the access credentials for the database.

## Data Model

- The foundation of a report is built upon data modeling and it plays a crucial role in the process.
- All the visuals in the report will be created based on the data model.
- The overall performance of the report is impacted by inadequate data modeling.
- For this project, we adopted the Snowflakes data modeling approach.
